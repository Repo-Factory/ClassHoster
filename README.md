# Host ANY Class!

## Description
Long READMEs are scary, so I'll keep this short. There is more info in the docs/README.md.
This package is meant to take YOUR class, and make it very easy to use. Do this.

    git clone https://github.com/Repo-Factory/ClassHoster && cd ClassHoster
    install.sh && ROBOT.py g
    
You can see generated stubs here for example class I provided.

    code ~/ROBOT_LIB/ROBOT_API.py

Running ROBOT.py script will host the classes provided in ROBOT_SYSTEMS. Place in your systems to host them.
